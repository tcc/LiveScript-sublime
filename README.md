# LiveScript-sublime #

[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) bundle for [LiveScript](http://gkz.github.com/LiveScript/).

Initially based on [LiveScript bundle](https://github.com/paulmillr/LiveScript.tmbundle), and mixed 
with `Native` [CoffeeScript bundle](https://github.com/Xavura/CoffeeScript-Sublime-Plugin) of Sublime Text 2.

Currently, it's more smooth in Sublime Text 2, but keymap not working. 

## Installation ##

Sublime stores packages in the following locations:

	Nix: ~/.config/sublime-text-2/packages
	Mac: ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
	Win: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages

Open a Terminal/Console and run the following commands, replacing `PACKAGE_PATH` with the path corresponding to your OS above.

	cd PACKAGE_PATH
	git clone https://github.com/tcc/LiveScript-sublime.git LiveScript
